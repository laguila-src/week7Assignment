    <p style="text-align:center">The Trencas style (Spain) of mosaics represented a unique combination of shapes, sizes, textures, and colors.  </p>

    <p>
        Mosaic is the art of creating images with an assemblage of small pieces of colored glass, stone, or other materials. The earliest known examples of
        mosaics made of different materials were found at a temple building in Ubaid, Mesopotamia, and are dated to the second half of 3nd millennium BCE.
        They consist of pieces of colored stones, shells and ivory.

    <h3>Themes</h3>
    <p>
        The most popular subject for mosaics was mythological scenes, such as the triumphs of Neptune, which are frequently found. The Orpheus myth (with animals) and the muses, sometimes with the god Apollo, 
        are also often illustrated. Inspiration could also come from daily life, like hunting (often with dogs), agriculture, fishing, as well as arts and crafts. The four seasons and the sea are also the 
        subject of numerous mosaics.
